tube is a Youtube-like (without censorship and features you don't need!) Video Sharing App written in Go which also supports automatic transcoding to MP4 H.265 AAC, multiple collections and RSS feed.

### Features

- Easy to add videos (just move a file into the folder)
- Easy to upload videos (just use the builtin uploader and automatic transcoder!)
- Builtin ffmpeg-based Transcoder that automatically converts your uploaded content to MP4 H.264 / AAC
- Builtin automatic thumbnail generator
- No database (video info pulled from file metadata)
- No JavaScript (the player UI is entirely HTML, except for the uploader which degrades!))
- Easy to customize CSS and HTML template
- Automatically generates RSS feed (at /feed.xml)
- Clean, simple, familiar UI
